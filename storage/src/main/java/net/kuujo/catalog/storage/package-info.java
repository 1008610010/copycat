/**
 * Provides a standalone segmented log for Copycat's <a href="https://raftconsensus.github.io/">Raft</a> implementation.
 * <p>
 * The log is designed as a standalone journal built on Copycat's {@link net.kuujo.catalyst.buffer.Buffer} abstraction.
 * The buffer abstraction allows Copycat's {@link net.kuujo.catalog.storage.Log} to write to memory or disk based on the
 * buffer type.
 * <p>
 * While the log is not dependent on the Raft algorithm, it does implement many features in support of the Raft implementation.
 * Specifically, the log is not an append-only log. Rather, it supports appending to, truncating, and compacting the
 * log.
 * <p>
 * The log achieves fast sequential writes by segmenting itself internally and compacting segments separately and
 * combining segments when necessary. Compaction works by iterating over a segment or segments,
 * {@link net.kuujo.copycat.io.storage.EntryFilter filtering} entries out of the segment, and rewriting the segment to a new
 * {@link net.kuujo.catalyst.buffer.Buffer}. Compaction is done in two stages: major and minor. The minor compaction stage
 * relates to compacting a single segment. The log will prioritize minor compaction for more recent segments first.
 * Periodically, the log will execute a major compaction wherein all segments of the log are compacted together. This
 * means the entire log is traversed from start to finish, and segments are combined in cases where enough entries have
 * been removed.
