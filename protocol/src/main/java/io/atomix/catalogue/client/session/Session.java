/**
 * Provides event-based methods for monitoring Raft sessions and communicating between Raft clients and servers.
 * <p>
 * Each client or server connected to any server in a Raft cluster must open a {@link Session}.
 * Sessions can be used by both clients and servers to monitor the connection status of another client or server. When
 * a client first connects to a server, it must register a new session. Once the session has been registered, listeners
 * registered via {@link #onOpen(Consumer)} will be called on <em>both the client and server side</em>. Thereafter, the
 * session can be used to {@link #publish(String, Object)} and {@link #onEvent(String, Consumer) receive} events between client and
 * server.
 * <p>
 * Sessions represent a connection between a single client and all servers in a Raft cluster. Session information
 * is replicated via the Raft consensus algorithm, and clients can safely switch connections between servers without
 * losing their session. Session implementations guarantee linearizability for session messages by coordinating
 * between the client and a single server at any given time. This means messages {@link #publish(String, Object) published}
 * via the {@link Session} are guaranteed to arrive on the other side of the connection exactly once and in the order
 * in which they are sent. In the event of a server-to-client message being lost, the message will be resent so long
 * as at least one Raft server is able to communicate with the client and the client's session does not {@link #isExpired()
 * expire} while switching between servers.
 * <p>
 * Messages are sent to the other side of the session using the {@link #publish(String, Object)} method:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     session.publish("myEvent", "Hello world!");
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * When the message is published, it will be queued to be sent to the other side of the connection. Catalog guarantees
 * that the message will arrive within the session timeout unless the session itself times out.
 * <p>
 * To listen for events on a session register a {@link Consumer} via {@link #onEvent(String, Consumer)}:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     session.onEvent("myEvent", message -> System.out.println("Received: " + message));
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Messages will always be received in the same thread and in the order in which they were sent by the other side of
 * the connection. Note that messages can be sent and received from the client or server side of the connection.
