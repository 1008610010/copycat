 * Base interface for operations that modify system state.

 * is submitted to the cluster, if the command is received by a follower, the Raft protocol dictates that it must be
 * forwarded to the cluster leader. Once the leader receives a command, it logs and replicates the command to a majority
 * of the cluster before applying it to its state machine and responding with the result.
