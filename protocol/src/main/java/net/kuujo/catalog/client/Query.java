/**
 * Raft state queries read system state.
 * <p>
 * Queries are submitted by clients to a Raft server to read Raft cluster-wide state. In contrast to
 * {@link Command commands}, queries allow for more flexible
 * {@link ConsistencyLevel consistency levels} that trade consistency for performance.
 * <p>
 * All queries must specify a {@link #consistency()} with which to execute the query. The provided consistency level
 * dictates how queries are submitted to the Raft cluster. Higher consistency levels like
 * {@link ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE} and {@link ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE_LEASE}
 * are forwarded to the cluster leader, while lower levels are allowed to read from followers for higher throughput.
 * <p>
 * By default, all queries should use the strongest consistency level, {@link ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE}.
 * It is essential that users understand the trade-offs in the various consistency levels before using them.
